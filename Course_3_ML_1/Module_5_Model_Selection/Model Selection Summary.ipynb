    "# Model Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How to select best fit model for given data?\n",
    "2. How to compare different models without building them explicitly?\n",
    "\n",
    "**_The central issue in machine learning is how to extrapolate learnings from the finite available data to all possible inputs of the same kind?_**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Occam's razor\n",
    "- When in dilemma, choose simpler model\n",
    "- the model should be as simple as necessary but not simpler than that\n",
    "- simplicity can be in terms of space complexity, time complexity, representation etc \n",
    "- simplicity is not expected to cost robustness of the model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simpler models vs complex models\n",
    "- simpler models are usually more generic i.e. more likely to be applicable on unseen data \n",
    "- in contrast a complex model is specialized for a set of data which may not give desired results on unseen data \n",
    "- simpler models require fewer training samples than complex models \n",
    "- simpler models are more robust \n",
    "- simpler models may make more errors in training as against complex models which may do very well on the training data but pooerly on unseen data \n",
    "- simpler models make fewer assumptions \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overfitting\n",
    "- models are trained on training data but their efficacy is measured on unseen data in real world\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "- Variance is the variance in output of the model when some training data changes. \n",
    "- Complex models have high variance thus needs more changes when training data changes\n",
    "- Thus variance for a model is degree of change in the model itself with respect to changes in training data.\n",
    "- Variance is about consistancy\n",
    "- Bias quantifies how accurate is the model on unseen (test) data.\n",
    "- Complex model with large enough training data can do very accurate job of prediction.\n",
    "- Bias is about accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical issues in choosing model\n",
    "- Type of data \n",
    "- Data quality \n",
    "- Dimentiality of the data \n",
    "- Nature of variables - continuous vs categorical \n",
    "\n",
    "## Class of models\n",
    "Based on the the of data following are the classes of models \n",
    "- High dimentional data \n",
    "- Noisy data \n",
    "- Real time data \n",
    "- Large amount of data \n",
    "- Missing data \n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularization\n",
    "- to prevent the model from becoming complex \n",
    "- its part of the learning algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hyperparameters\n",
    "- input to learning algorithm \n",
    "- tuning parameters to keep the model simple \n",
    "\n",
    "## Training data \n",
    "- used to train the model\n",
    "- statistical charactaristics of the original data must be preserved\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation data \n",
    "- used to tune hyperparameters\n",
    "- statistical charactaristics of the original data must be preserved\n",
    "\n",
    "## Test data \n",
    "- used to test the model\n",
    "- statistical charactaristics of the original data must be preserved\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cross-validation\n",
    "- Split the original data into different subets, maybe shuffle the data \n",
    "- use combination of these subsets as training and test data to build different models \n",
    "- choose best performing model from built models\n"
